**Result**: Measurable outcomes and career impact

#### Example Responses

**Question**: "Tell me about a challenging technical problem you solved."

**Response**: 
"In my CAN-RT-Gateway project, I needed to achieve sub-50 microsecond latency for safety-critical automotive messages while maintaining system stability. The challenge was balancing real-time performance with system reliability.

I approached this by implementing a PREEMPT_RT kernel with custom priority schemes, optimizing interrupt handling, and creating a zero-copy message passing architecture. I used cyclictest for precise latency measurement and iteratively optimized the system.

The result was a system that consistently achieved 30Œºs average latency with 99.9% of messages under 50Œºs, exceeding automotive industry requirements. This demonstrated my ability to deliver safety-critical embedded solutions that meet strict timing requirements."
